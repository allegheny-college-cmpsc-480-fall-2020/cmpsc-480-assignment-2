## Overview
 
Whether a job ad, graduate school application requirements, or guidelines for applying to a service program, the process of figuring out what recruiters or readers are looking for in your materials may appear to be a contest in mind-reading. It's clear that these documents are asking you to prove that your history, skills, and experience are the right combination of _something_, but what does that mean?

You can think of job listings as plot sketches for short stories about what a given organization does and what it thinks it is. This is more than just the specific industry, skills, or qualifications listed -- this also involes how a given company, school, or organization talks about _itself_.

And, just as you are in control of your version of your career narrative and how you tell it, you possess equal agency in job or graduate school searches. In essence, you're looking for a place that you think continues your story. You just need to find it. Easy, right?

Unfortunately, not so.

This week's exercise will help you start the process of finding and understanding what the employment landscape looks like for the various options you might be considering. 

## Assignment guidelines

Choose one or more of the options below.

* [Academic programs](#academic-programs)
* [Professional employment](#professional-employment)
* [Service or government](#service-or-government)

### Academic programs

Searching for graduate programs is a bit tricky. One can rely on rankings, but I often advise against using these -- at least as a primary metric for fit. But, you know who you know for a reason. Many Allegheny students, for example, have deep interests in programs at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) and [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu/). 

(Full disclosure: you should know about [cooperative programs between Allegheny CS and CMU](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/cmu/). Quite a few students pursue these.)

In your career narrative, you did your best to define the areas that you're interested in. For example, consider something like "Computational Biology." Rather than searching for the top CS or biology graduate programs, you'd do best by searching for Computational Biology instead -- even if there are no programs at "ranked" schools (there are, but let's assume for the sake of this example that there aren't).

If you're not sure which area(s) you'd like to pursue, it's important to start thinking about whittling down your CS interests or passions to something specific. Once you've done that, you can turn to resources like search engines.

#### Your assignment

In `summary.md`, add information which profiles various graduate school programs. This isn't a final list; this exercise will introduce you to the process of finding more applicable or interesting programs. It's designed to give you transferrable skills to use and begin exploring on your own.

- [ ] Find up to five (5) programs that you're interested in
  * Rank them `1` - `5` based on your current interest
  * Label each entry with the school name and personal rank
- [ ] In application guidelines and requirements find:
  * Required exams, minimum scores
  * Number and type of transcripts required
  * Requirements for personal statements
  * Requirements for C.V. or other professional documents
  * Number of recommendations requested or required
  * Deadlines for all materials
  * Names of faculty whose specialties you're interested in working in

#### Important resources and considerations

---

* Professors, friends, or acquaintances that have completed graduate programs
* Affiliations or schools that you've seen in research you've read or conducted
* Rankings -- if (and only if) there's a program in your area of interest

### Professional employment

Allegheny College offers connections to several resources via the office of Career Education. These are split out by predominate type of listing below. Keep in mind that internships and full-time employment opportunities _can be listed_ on all of the sites below; some specialize in particular types, though.

#### Your assignment

  * Self-starter
  * Goals-oriented
* In a different color, highlight skills written in the listing which _match_ skills you already have
  * Does the listing characterize these as "required" or "desired" skills?
* In yet a different color, highlight skills written in the listing which are _skills you would need to learn_
  * Does the listing characterize these as "required" or "desired" skills?
* Write a brief summary of why this particular opportunity stands out to you
